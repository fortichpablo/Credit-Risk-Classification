# Credit-Risk-Classification
In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

1. Provide an overview that explains the purpose of this analysis.
   
Answer: The objective of this analysis is to establish and assess the effectiveness of a data model designed to forecast the creditworthiness of potential borrowers within peer-to-peer lending platforms.

2. Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy, precision, and recall scores of the machine learning model.

Answer: Balanced Accuracy Score: 95.20% → This indicates that considering both the sensitivity (recall and/or true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) of the model, the overall prediction accuracy was 95.2%.
Precision Score: 92% → This signifies that 92% of the predicted positives were accurate.
Recall Score: 95% → This denotes that the model achieved a 95% precision in identifying true positive values among all positive predictions made.

3. Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you don’t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.

Answer: I recommend deploying this model for predicting borrower creditworthiness because it demonstrates over 95% accuracy in projecting the repayment status of the initial loan. This level of accuracy can be effectively integrated into a business risk profile, ensuring a steady capital flow for lenders to sustain their operations and generate profits.
